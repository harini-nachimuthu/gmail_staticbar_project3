# **Gmail Top Bar Replica**

In this project, I focused on creating a static HTML and CSS layout that replicates the top bar of Gmail's interface. The design emphasizes the use of modern web techniques for creating clean and responsive layouts.

## **Project Highlights:**
- **Responsive Design**: The layout ensures a seamless user experience across different devices, adjusting smoothly for mobile and desktop views.
- **Gmail-Inspired Top Bar**: The project includes a top navigation bar with a Gmail-like design, featuring logo placement, search bar, and quick access icons.
- **Custom Styling**: Implemented custom CSS to match the aesthetic of Gmail, including color schemes, font styles, and icon placements.

## **Screenshot:**
Here is a snapshot of the Gmail top bar:
